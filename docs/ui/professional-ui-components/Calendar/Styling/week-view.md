# Styling the RadCalendar Week View

> The week view is the same as the month view. The same rules and requirements for [month view styling]({% slug calendar-monthview-styling %} "Read more about styling in Month view mode") are applicable.

To apply custom styling to the week view, you need to initialize the `weekViewStyle` property of `RadCalendar` with a `CalendarWeekViewStyle` instance.

The following example shows how to style the week view:
